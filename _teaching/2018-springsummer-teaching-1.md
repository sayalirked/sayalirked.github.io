I was an Instructor for the undergraduate-level course of 'Applied Computational Methods (MET 4076) in [College of Engineering and Applied Sciences](https://ceas.uc.edu/) at the [University of Cincinnati](https://www.uc.edu/) during the semesters of Spring and Summer 2018. This class included undergraduate students with a total enrollment of 40.

I had designed the programming sessions for implementation of various numerical methods applied in engineering problems. Students implemented the numerical methods in different programming languages including MATLAB. The repository [Numerical Methods](https://github.com/sayrjked/Numerical_Methods) contains the implementation in MATLAB.
