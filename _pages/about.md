I'm a Ph.D. candidate in mechanical engineering, advised by [Dr. Kumar Vemaganti](https://researchdirectory.uc.edu/p/vemagaks) at the University of Cincinnati ([Vemaganti Research Group](http://vemaganti.com)). My research is focused on Bayesian learning in computational rheology - applications to soft tissues and polymers, an area that is highly computational and involves multiple disciplines of study including Bayesian statistics, mechanical engineering and scientific computing. I'm investigating rheological constitutive models of solids (soft biological materials and polymers), applying Bayesian statistical approaches to analyze the mechanical behavior of solids in order to improve the reliability of computer model predictions in real-world applications (traumatic brain injury, tissue engineering, computer-aided surgery, product design, material and food processing).

I'm currently a graduate research assistant working on projects in collaboration with Procter & Gamble (P&G) at the [UC Simulation Center](https://ceas.uc.edu/research/centers-labs/uc-simulation-center.html). My work involves employing physics-based predictive-design-approach to drive and outline process design and optimization guidelines using commercial finite element analysis (FEA) and programming tools.

I earned my Master of Science (M.S.) in mechanical engineering in 2016 from the University of Kansas, where my research was focused on computational fluid mechanics ([Computational Mechanics Laboratory](https://me.engr.ku.edu/karan-s-suranas-research)).

### Summary
- Strong background in scientific computing and numerical methods.
- Expertise in different aspects of uncertainty quantification including optimal experimental design and calibration.
- Experience in the application of the Bayesian framework to solve probabilistic inverse problems and traditional optimization methods to solve deterministic inverse problems in solid and fluid mechanics.
- Comprehensive programming skills in Python, Julia, C++, C, MATLAB languages.
- Demonstrated ability to work both independently as well as collaboratively as a member of cross-functional teams in industry (P&G) and academia.
- Proven ability to effectively handle multiple projects concurrently and manage competing priorities under demanding deadlines.

### Research Interests
Uncertainty quantification, machine learning, scientific computing, numerical analysis, solid and fluid mechanics.
